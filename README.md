Ok so heres the dealio. I put this here so that I can view my  work in the future without anyone stopping me. Some in previous years have told me that it is next to impossible to recover the labs that we do this year, so if you, yes you looking at MY repo thinking "hmm, its 7:15, I haven't even started the lab because of how boring it is but I'd really like to get the points for it," well then knock yourself out. I really don't care. You know what, this repo is for you. I get it. I really hated this class 90 percent of the time. It's just so excruciatingly, mind-numbingly boring.
